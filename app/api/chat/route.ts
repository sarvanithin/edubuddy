    beginner: `🌱 **Let's Start with Photosynthesis!**

Great question! Let me break this down super simply:

**The Basic Idea:**
Plants are like little factories that make their own food using sunlight!

**Three Simple Steps:**
1. ☀️ **Sunlight** - Plants catch sunlight with their green leaves
2. 💧 **Water** - Roots pull water from the soil
3. 💨 **CO2** - Leaves take CO2 from the air
4. ✨ **Magic Happens** - They mix all these together using sunlight energy
5. 🍎 **Result** - Food (sugar) for the plant + Oxygen we breathe!

**Simple Formula:**
Sunlight + Water + CO2 = Sugar + Oxygen

**Now let me check your understanding:**
❓ **Quick Question:** When a plant makes its own food, what gas do you think it releases into the air that we breathe?
A) Carbon Dioxide
B) Nitrogen
C) Oxygen
D) Hydrogen

Reply with just A, B, C, or D!`,

    intermediate: `🌱 **Deep Dive: Photosynthesis**

Excellent curiosity! Let me explain the mechanism:

**The Two Stages:**

**1️⃣ Light Reactions (in Thylakoid)**
- Chlorophyll absorbs photons
- Water molecules split (photolysis): 2H₂O → 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ + O₂
- Electrons move through electron transport chain
- ATP and NADPH are produced
- O₂ is released as byproduct

**2️⃣ Calvin Cycle (Dark Reactions in Stroma)**
- CO₂ is fixed by RuBisCO enzyme
- 3-phosphoglycerate is reduced
- G3P molecules are formed
- Some G3P regenerates RuBP
- Others build glucose

**Overall Equation:**
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + Light Energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

**Key Concepts:**
- Photosystems I & II
- Electron transport chain
- Chemiosmosis
- Carbon fixation

❓ **Skill Check:** What's the role of the light reactions in photosynthesis?
A) Directly fix CO₂
B) Produce ATP and NADPH
C) Build glucose molecules
D) All of the above

Let me know your answer (A/B/C/D), and we'll discuss the next level!`,

    advanced: `🌱 **Advanced Photosynthesis: Quantum & Ecological Perspectives**

Excellent! You're ready for some advanced concepts:

**Quantum Aspects:**
- Quantum coherence in light-harvesting complexes
- Resonance energy transfer with 100% efficiency
- Excitonic states and decoherence
- Femtosecond spectroscopy findings

**C3, C4, and CAM Pathways:**
- **C3 Plants**: Rice, wheat, soybeans (2 carbons in Calvin cycle)
- **C4 Plants**: Corn, sugarcane (4 carbons initially) - more efficient in hot/dry
- **CAM Plants**: Succulents, cacti - open stomata at night

**Enzyme Kinetics:**
- RuBisCO: ~3 reactions/sec (slow enzyme)
- Carboxylation vs Oxygenation (photorespiration)
- Regulation by ATP, NADPH, ADP

**Ecological Implications:**
- Global carbon fixation: ~200 Gt/year
- Climate change effects on photosynthetic capacity
- Agricultural yield optimization

❓ **Advanced Validation:** Why do C4 plants outcompete C3 plants in hot, dry climates despite C4's extra ATP cost?

Think about stomatal limitations and CO₂ fixation efficiency!`,

    beginner: `📐 **Let's Solve: 2x + 5 = 15**

Perfect! Let me teach you step-by-step:

**Step 1: Understand the Goal**
We need to find what number x is!

**Step 2: Get x alone**
- Right now: 2x + 5 = 15
- We need to remove the +5
- So subtract 5 from BOTH sides:
  2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
  2x = 10

**Step 3: Divide to find x**
- We have: 2x = 10
- Divide both sides by 2:
  2x ÷ 2 = 10 ÷ 2
  x = 5

**Step 4: Check Your Answer!**
Plug x = 5 back into original:
2(5) + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 ✅ Correct!

**Key Rule:** Whatever you do to one side, do to the other side!

❓ **Your Turn - Quick Check:**
If 3x + 2 = 14, what is x?
Think about: What do you need to subtract first? Then divide?

    intermediate: `📐 **Linear Equations & Systems**

Good level! Let's go deeper:

**Method 1: Substitution**
- Solve one equation for a variable
- Substitute into the other
- Solve the resulting equation

**Method 2: Elimination**
- Multiply equations to align coefficients
- Add/subtract to eliminate a variable
- Solve for remaining variable

**Your Problem: 2x + 5 = 15**
- Isolate term with x: 2x = 15 - 5 = 10
- Divide by coefficient: x = 10/2 = 5

**Related Concepts:**
- Linear vs Non-linear equations
- Slope-intercept form: y = mx + b
- Solving systems: 2x2, 3x3 matrices
- Graphical solutions

**Real-world Applications:**
